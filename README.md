What this does is :
Allows the admin by the help of the django admin panel to add and edit member data CRUD
The members are listed on the page ,each with individual public info:like joined since ,phone number.
If used,this project can be used to ease record handling in clubs and club registration 
future prospect ,is to add a signup page where new members can signup and they are automatically added to the database hence displayed.
